# Haskell-Basics
HC1T1 - Task 1: Function Composition Define three functions:

double: Multiplies a number by 2. increment: Increases a number by 1. doubleThenIncrement: Uses function composition to apply double first and then increment. HC1T2 - Task 2: Pure Function Example Write a function circleArea that calculates the area of a circle given the radius. Ensure that itâ€™s pure and does not depend on any external state.

HC1T3 - Task 3: Checking if a Number is Greater than 18 Write a function greaterThan18 that checks whether a given number is greater than 18.

HC1T4 - Task 4: Composing a Function to Process Player Data Write three functions:

extractPlayers: Takes a list of tuples ((name, score)) and extracts the player names. sortByScore: Sorts the list of players by score in descending order. topThree: Returns the top three players. Compose these functions into getTopThreePlayers. HC1T5 - Task 5: Laziness in Haskell Create a function infiniteNumbers that generates an infinite list of numbers. Extract only the first n elements.

HC1T6 - Task 6: Using Type Signatures Define a function addNumbers that takes two integers and returns their sum.

HC1T7 - Task 7: Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius Write a function fToC that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.

HC1T8 - Task 8: Higher-Order Functions Create a function applyTwice that applies a function twice to an input value.
